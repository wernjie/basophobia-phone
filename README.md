# Basophobia Phone

As the name implies, Basophobia Phone is an app that makes your phone sentient and able to fear falls. More specifically, it allows phones to scream in fear when they're falling onto the ground. Available on all major smartphone OSes, i.e. Android and iOS. Looking for Windows Phone support? I'm sorry, but Windows Phone has *fallen*.

This app continues to run in the background as well, so you can "impress" your friends on how your phone has "feelings" and how "AI is going to take over the world". 

PS: It is not available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store as smartphone abuse is bad (cause most would just download the app and throw their phones in the air). It also violates Apple's guidelines anyway.

## Features

### Plug and play
- Plain and simple. Starts running as soon as you open the app, stops when you kill it. 
- Screams when it's falling and feels hurt when colliding after a fall. 
- Only scared when in free fall: holding your phone while moving your hand quickly downwards will not cause it to scream. It might be hurt though.
- In the main screen, *Green* or *White* indicates happiness, *Red* indicates fear.
- Runs in the background.

### Customizable post-fall processing (currently iOS only)
\*Requires modification of source code.
- Ability to perform an action after the device has fallen.
- Process which device corners have collided with the ground.
- Approximate the distance the device has fallen.

## Disclaimers

I'm not responsible for any damage your phone may have encountered arising from the use of this app.

This project was started just for fun back in 2017, and now lives in this repository. Do not take this seriously as a fall detection mechanism.
